<p> DinnerHost brings the most interesting people to the table to help mentor and improve their communities from lifestyles to careers to ideas. </p>

 <p> Today marks the launch of DinnerHost, a new website that unlocks the ability for interesting people to become leaders in their community, using food and drink as a lubricant for meaningful discussions. </p>

<p>
It’s difficult to make time to become an active leader and to mentor ambitious and curious individuals in your local community. DinnerHost makes it easy to be a community leader as well as engage offline with active Twitter followers. Once hosts are accepted, they can easily reserve the date and restaurant that works best for them.</p>

<p>Developing personal relationships with interesting people is nearly impossible without connections, money and time. DinnerHost truly bridges the gap between online aspirations to meet interesting people and meaningful offline connections. You will enjoy the opportunity to learn from both the host and others who share the same interests—all over delicious pre fixed family style menus at the best restaurants in your city. </p>
<p>
“There is almost nothing as challenging as leading groups of people. It helps you grow, give back to and improve your community. We believe great food is the soil that helps trees take root and grow. My dream is for local community organizers to be the most influential thought leaders in the world instead of radio talk show hosts, TV personalities and advertisers.” (CEO)<p>
</p>

Go to DinnerHost.com and apply to be a host at a dinner in your community. Give your Twitter followers the first chance to book the meal, and then open it up to the public.</p>
